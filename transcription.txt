what is the absolute best laptop you can get for 500 bucks we went to best buy anything about this page I am talking more
power more pictures like this video the Ridge your installation practical 10% of your purchase and get free shipping she has been around laptops on
aliexpress but recently be launched their own store where we first saw this machine and we were more that you could get a core i5
laptop with a frequency display for just 500 price say it doesn't even feel like a $500 laptop regardless of swag if you ask me
how much I thought this machine was worth I said that publishers at 999 from my kind of like you know about this notification standard
barrel Jack charger with that said however it does have Canon USB support that does take up to 65 water resource long as you have
a USB C charger around then you can use USB PD is also got USB type a headphone microphone project and a microSD slot expected
16 / 10 display Microsoft Surface on this page a laptop pretty good this keyboard amazing or have $500 laptops just got better to find
out the $500 options on best buy and found a few things you're going to want to keep in mind you want to be a
bargain Hunter find something on sale you should expect something went to two generations old in the i5 or 5 range 16GB real non emmc
SST and least 1080p display one thing to really look out for is the Wi-Fi connect browsing significance we choose the HP laptop Pavilion prospector
it's literally just called HP laptop inside its name you don't have purchased for a budget conscious machines but how does it compare I can
tell you right now I feel like why does it feel so much better it's not even but it feels thicker did you notice that
looks like I know what's this bone figure the tree obviously is going to have some advantages here to type is along with the type
C HTML full size SD card slot and headphone microphone Jack does this type C accept power and delivery though because it also ships with
a barrel Jack let's try it I don't understand on this one story like this probably a big deal for them to having just one
charger in your bag for your phone your laptop maybe you have a Nintendo switch or something like that it's not I feel like it
from 8 to 10 years ago there is here and this trackpad you are going to find yourself wishing you had one more like this
is this one was brightness for the comparison ok I need to put the same wallpaper latest different states of the screen is not available
and has a number has these Arrow keys that make me want to murder someone I think those are fine Naseeb film 2.99 pounds 3.68
and telling a mind of course the HP does have a substantially larger display it comes under 3.5 I think that's pretty reasonable as long
as a good science but for context this is what is the Dragon fight lateral stability and security key inconsistency I don't mind that I
actually agree with his great though because for me it's the sound in the field overall the holding capacity but while I don't want the
keys which is themselves there is so much flex in the back that you are never going to get a clean solid tactile touch typing
experience service too but to its credit at least it's more consistent across the entire body with the HP laptop using a glass top rating
premium like that both of them function well as expected registering everything from tabs to drugs to multitudes for kids maybe he is doing all
that I am doing is opening paint and paint pocketing red at 255 that is the same rate there is so much worse than I
expected this looks so that and doll and lifeless on the one hand It is a match style this place where does affect your perception
of colour of vibrancy even if it's expected it's so disappointing and it was not the only way that you have a way with this
445 minutes with HP stuck in the dust at 18 years which sounds because our responsibility is non linear the HP will appear 80% is
bright but I can tell you doesn't feel like 82% is bright man when you hit this thing that's a big difference back to the
display is not true manage 97% cover of the srgb colour space with HP coming in at 63% how to know why the perceived difference
in brightness is so much greater place on major role there and this got it as for accuracy of 2.4 with the maximum maximum 19.74
because even if the panels calibrated it just doesn't have the physical ability to represent those colours with that said it's not like I'm going
to recommend that to be for a professional courier anything like that is not for the CPU Intel core i5 1235 you that is 810
Core processor with two performance course and 8 efficiency course and while it's only a generation new year 1135 G7 in PHP the jump from
11 to smoke PHP in every test before atom which includes games while neither this is marketed as a hard core gaming machinery anything like
that we do expect people to play casual games like dollar to a rocket league on them and especially with the turbo mode enable which
gives it about 11% more performance the two week like how bad the HP electricity map or related topics Wapas something on it look at
that it was brownish listen how much fees I don't think we even need a sound chamber to tell which one one that is another
thing you need to look out from budget laptops are cashless SST but to explain why the terrible let's take a look at this one
terabyte drive from xpg rate here you can see Flash Memory storage which contains a map over all of the data on this flagship is
stored kind of like the computer the librarian would use without increase which means a lot of cashless assets have a short warranty period than
one with the proper cash I was supposed to do a demo here showing how sometimes crystal this mark can be deceiving the two reactions
but I guess that it's garbage dump and this poem but there is a solar light under these two screws right here is an opinion
that I would recommend you start saving up to fill pretty much by the way there's a little formal pant little spacer that allows that
SST to dissipate heat is not running very sensitive Behaviour for women hey Alexa 7:20 p.m. that's the maximum and while the TV is bad
if I had to guess I said wow that's not fair at all what I am completely blow now looks like just a solid brown
looks like at home for kids I take achieve the HP is so much louder and some more tomorrow I take my phone also customer
your first HP certified tickets if someone necessary just put this course here and here it doesn't matter so $500 laptop where you trying to
impress or like there and there yeah like you did on this much more premium model certified jackets ok now listen 10% more than the
capacity of the HP and that combined with a 12 vs 1110 CPU should adapt to significantly very life and fortunately in the world as
a baseline impressive 6 hours and 52 minutes now 3 hours and 17 minutes right now in the balance profile with battery saver on logic
being referred from multiple laptop makers that less than 10% of users ever touch a laptop battery and the response is one of the most
incredible takes you ever seen with the Samsung expected for continuous usage while the client 8 hours is for on and off usage when you're
using your laptop intermediately I mean 80 hours of battery life of my laptop how do you have the email it's possible that some of
this is due to power management of the CPU so maybe it could be improved for the BIOS update I saw that Framework actually the
blog post recently talking about it that challenge of dealing with things like USB power management CPU power management program 1440 display I mean that
is a big part of why we like this thing so much in the first place but having a higher resolution higher brightness panel has
a big effect on your battery life for general usually answer that some people would sacrifice some battery life for a better screen but I'm
sure that a lot of people would actually remember probably using system memory for a cash but it's just like to control plastic which is
not connected to find out how many people for you so if you really fantastic and every other way for the price otherwise you might
